# Netflix-End-to-End-ELT-Project
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a relational database from raw data, cleaning and transforming it, and performing SQL queries to generate insights. The dataset used was the Netflix catalog, which includes information about movies, TV shows, directors, cast members, genres, release years, and more.
